#### Article published at The New Indian Express edex: https://www.edexlive.com/happening/2020/aug/23/why-gogrocy-developed-by-nit-rourkela-student-decided-to-focus-on-tier-ii-adn-tier-iii-cities-13951.html

## Why project-raasan?
The key idea behind this independent venture is to digitalize ration stores and help forge a connection between the store and the nearest customer. The immediate target of the venture is to deliver the aforementioned items to people at their doorstep so that they do not have to step outside their houses amid a lockdown. The business model is meant to be branded in a manner that attracts customers and creates a customer base at a low budget. An impediment to the otherwise noble venture is the fact that the delivery guys sometimes decline taking out the orders because of the lockdown.

## How to build it on your system
* Fork the repo and clone it.
* This project uses firebase mobile authentication, so there are two ways around it.
  * Want to build the full firebase auth workflow
    * You will need to place a google-services.json file in **android/app** directory
    * The file contains sensitive info, hence to get a copy of it, do open a ISSUE, and we'd get in touch with you
  * You want to build the app more quickly
    * You can use a whitelisted number to get into the app.
    * Using a whitelisted number means that you won't be getting an OTP, or see the sign up flow, as it has already been used before, so someone already has signed up using the number
    * White listed number- +91-111-1111-111 , OTP-123456, password- gameison
 
 ## Problems
* You may find some null pointer problems, do try to change the tab and come back to that tab, some of the problems are fixed
* Another way you may try is restarting the app!
* We're actively working on these bugs
* Orders Option is forever loading, that is a problem on our part, so don't wait for it to load
